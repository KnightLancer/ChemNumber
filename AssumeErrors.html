<h2>Assumptions and Errors</h2>

<h3><em>Question 1</em></h3>
<p id="words">Initially I assumed I could go as far as to find the chemical reactions that occur between cetirizine HCl and a certain amount of a specific allergen. However, when I conducted research, I went from cetirizine HCl to the antiallergenic effects of the H1 receptor antagonists. My search took me from the chemical down to the gene that controls interactions with environmental allergens. The allergens themselves did not have a basic chemical equation, because they are composed of many other factors such as dust, mites, and pollen. Along with further understanding of the project, I came to realize I  need only quantify attributes of cetirizine HCl rather than its interactions with the body and allergens.</p>

<h3><em>Question 2</em></h3>
<p id="words">I made errors in the presentation of information in this question. I believed a build up of the equation would serve to better inform the audience. However, scientific presentation of dimensional analysis requires that all information be shown in one line of equation. Since I was analyzing 5 elements, I thought to make equations for each of them. This was also not a good idea, since my website would then be littered with equations that were missing some units. I went with a blank equation, where I had a table of information above it so that the audience can plug in the values and then find the results. Of course, I had the results in the subsequent table. I also added a "check my answer" equation, where it shows that adding up the grams of each element in the 10 mg of cetirizine HCl adds up to 10 mg almost perfectly.</p>

<h3><em>Question 3</em></h3>
<p id="words">My initial idea for this question is an absurd one: to find how many tablets would it take to have at least one gram of each element at a time. This is influenced by false information I acquired in a previous version of question 2. I had built a completely wrong equation  in question 2 during the earlier stages of my site building, and from it it returned very miniscule numbers for the grams of each element. the numbers reached past 27 decimal places, and then I knew something was wrong. It took many weeks of peer and teacher help and more research to realize I was wrong, and thus I fixed the equation with the help of the teacher and finally returned correct amounts. Then I changed this question to involve stoichiometry, a method of value finding using other values of a chemical [equation]. Since I had correct values, I could use the grams of one element to built an equation to find another element's grams. Even in this stage I made errors: I used another incorrect equation in an earlier version, which output incorrect data. This was the incomplete equation:</p>

<p id="words">Comparing this with the correct equation in the Question 3 link, I was missing the last piece, which was the molar mass of the second element. I even had the information for the second element in my tables, and the though never occurred to me. Now I have three questions (all correct, fortunately) for this project. All these errors in the process were based on assumptions that I had the right numbers and equations each time, and thus believed the outputs were wrong, not my equations.</p>
