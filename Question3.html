    <h2>Question 3. Can I use the grams of an element to find the grams of another element?</h2>
<br>
    <h3>The process:</h3>
    <p id="words">I formed this question because I wanted to apply knowledge gained from the previous question. I learned of the equation from the Summit Learning playlist "Stoichiometry 2", where you can take the mass of one element to find the mass of another, as long as you have the molar masses and molecule count of each element. Remember the information:</p>
    <table align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Number of molecules</th>
        <th>Molar Mass (g/mol)</th>
        <th>Grams in 1 tablet</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Carbon</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>12.01</td>

    <p id="words">This is what the equation looks like when carbon is the 1st element and hydrogen is the 2nd element:</p>

    <p id="words">Before asking this question, I made some major errors when forming the equation. The idea was the same, but I was missing a step: the molar mass of the second element. The incomplete equation was:</p>
    <img src="equation11.png" width="50%">
    <p id="words">I first tried carbon to hydrogen. The answer was correct, if rounded, but when trying the other way around, I was oddly off by 0.001 when rounded. I tried with other elements like hydrogen and nitrogen, and even that answer was off. Once I realized the error, I added on the missing part and started getting correct answers.</p>
    <p id="words">The assumptions were that I thought the equation would work, and in the end it actually did!</p>
