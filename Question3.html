    <h2>Question 3. How many tablets would it take to get each element of cetirizine HCl to a have at least 1 gram?</h2>
<br>
    <h3>The process:</h3>
    <p id="words">This question was made because I wanted to have a question that applied the knowledge gained through the previous questions. As found out in the previous question, the grams of each element are extremely minuscule. I wanted to see how many tablets would barely give each element 1 gram for the fun of it. It took a lot of trial and error, like tons of it. I would start with the number of grams in 10 mg, then multiply it by 10<sup>26</sup> since 10<sup>27</sup> would make it a whole number. If needed, I would adjust the first value of 10<sup>26</sup> so the grams value would have 1 as its first digit. I then moved down the line, making sure that the next number was so that when I calculated the current number, it would be under 1 by just a tiny bit, say 0.1 off. I would continue moving down the line until I reached the last digit, and I would make sure the number made the answer a whole number 1. This question was born out of pure curiosity. The table below shows the grams in 10 mg and then the number of tablets needed for each corresponding element to have 1 gram.</p>
