            <p id="SumPar">In the exposition of this project, a random idea popped into my head: can I analyze my brotherâ€™s allergy medicine? The active ingredient in his Aller-tec tablets is cetirizine hydrochloride (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and the bottle already tells me that in one tablet there are 10 milligrams of this chemical. Initially I thought I could go as far as to find the chemical reactions that occur between cetirizine HCl and a certain amount of a specific allergen, however the factors that compose an allergen are much too complex and time consuming for a project that I read too much into. Therefore I set on a new course to find the conversion factors for milligrams, grams, and kilograms, as well as mass to mole conversions. I started with the molecular weight of cetirizine hydrochloride (HCl) and worked my way through my questions:</p>
