    <h2>Question 1. How many moles are in 10 mg of cetirizine HCl?</h2>
<br>
    <h3>The process:</h3>
    <p id="words"> I had such a tough time finding questions to answer. As said before, I really wanted to go down to the atomic relationships of allergens, but they would not be so easy to quanitfy. I therefore thought this question was a good first one. Sourcing PubChem, a credible source and the nation's library of medicine, the molecular weight of cetirizine HCl is 425.35 grams per mole (g/mol). From there I used this conversion factor:</p>
    <p id="conversion"><sup>1 mol C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>425.35 g</sub></p>
    <p id="words">I took 10 mg, which was the amount of C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in one tablet. Since the conversion factor had grams, I converted 10 mg to grams by dividing 10 mg by 1000, since there are 1000 mg in a gram.</p>
    <p id="conversion">0.01 grams x <sup>1 mol C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>425.35 g</sub></p>
    <p id="words">The result was 0.00002351005 moles.</p>
