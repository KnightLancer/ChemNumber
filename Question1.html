    <p id="words"> I had such a tough time finding questions to answer. As said before, I really wanted to go down to the atomic relationships of allergens, but they would not be so easy to quanitfy. I therefore thought this question was a good first one. Sourcing PubChem, a credible source and the nation's library of medicine, the molecular weight of cetirizine HCl is 425.35 grams per mole (g/mol). From there I used this conversion factor:</p>
    <p id="conversion"><sup>1 mol C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>425.35 g</sub></p>
